# Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE)

This folder contains supplementary data from ALE experiments conducted on bacterial strains to study their metabolic and respiratory adaptations over evolutionary time.

## ðŸ“„ Files Included

1. **Sample code of strains used in this study.xlsx**  
   Lists the strain codes, Each isolate or sample is named using the AIFR convention:
- **A** = Lineage (1â€“4)
- **I** = Isolate type (0 = population, 1 = clonal)
- **F** = Flask/passage number (e.g., F10 = 10th transfer)
- **R** = Biological replicate (R1â€“R4)

2. **List of mutated genes in strains isolated at the endpoint of the evolutionary trajectory.xlsx**  
   Contains gene-level mutation data (SNPs, indels, deletions) observed in endpoint isolates, highlighting potential adaptations.

3. **List of oligonucleotides used in this study.xlsx**  
   Provides sequences of primers used for PCR amplification, and genome complementation.

## ðŸ§ª Description

The ALE approach used here aimed to:
- Investigate the compensatory pathways when Ubiquinone biosynthesis are perturbed.
- Observe how bacterial respiratory chains evolve under selective pressure.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The mutations were validated via WGS and annotated using standard(breseq) pipelines.
