## 📂 Adaptive Laboratory Evolution

This folder contains information related to strains evolved under selection pressure:

- `Sample code...`: Internal codes and references to strains used
- `List of mutated genes...`: Mutations identified in endpoint isolates
- `List of oligonucleotides...`: Primers used for PCR amplification and gene complementation

---

## 📂 CO-CONSERVATION Analysis

This folder includes analysis of gene conservation and respiratory trait distribution across bacteria:

- `List of bacterial Genomes`: Presence/absence of genes in ~9000 bacterial genomes, covering MQ/UQ biosynthesis and NADH dehydrogenases
- `Co-conservation table`: Presence/absence of MQ/UQ biosynthesis and NADH dehydrogenases(NDH-I and NDH-II)
- `Gene specific e-values`: Custom HMM search cutoffs used for each gene family
- `Sequence similarity and kinetic parameters`: Comparison of NDH-2 from different species

---

## 📌 Notes

- All genomes used were publicly available (NCBI RefSeq or GenBank).
- Gene presence was predicted using HMM-based custom cutoffs.
- This repository supports reproducibility and transparency for downstream meta-analysis.
